# EnSToM: Enhancing Dialogue Systems with Entropy-Scaled Steering Vectors for Topic Maintenance

> üõ†Ô∏è This repository is **under active development**. Code and documentation will be released soon.

This is the official implementation of the paper:  
**"EnSToM: Enhancing Dialogue Systems with Entropy-Scaled Steering Vectors for Topic Maintenance"**

We propose **EnSToM**, a novel method that helps small language models maintain topic consistency in dialogues. Instead of relying on heavy fine-tuning, **EnSToM** dynamically adapts steering based on input uncertainty, offering both efficiency and robustness.

Beyond performance, we provide meaningful insights into the inner workings of LLMs by analyzing **layer-wise entropy patterns**, enhancing interpretability across the model‚Äôs layers.

Stay tuned ‚Äî we‚Äôre finalizing the release!
